# Overview

Campaign Buddy is an online interactive toolbox to assist Dungeon Masters and players to run Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) campaigns (storytelling based, roleplaying adventures played on a tabletop run by a Dungeon Master, or DM). Campaign Buddy’s purpose is to make the process of setting up, planning, and executing these campaigns simple, painless, and efficient. It is a interface that uses a collection of tools that target different aspects of running a campaign such as creating and managing players, creating maps, planning stories, keeping track of spells, items, and lore, and so on. While different implementations of these tools exist individually in various places, this tool seeks to integrate them into one convenient and customizable panel-based layout. This is important because DMs are often using multiple tools at the same time and need to be able to reference resources.
